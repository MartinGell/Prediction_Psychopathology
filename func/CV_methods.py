class TwoFoldDiscRep(_BaseKFold):
    """K-Folds cross-validator
    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Split
    dataset into k consecutive folds (without shuffling by default).
    Each fold is then used once as a validation while the k - 1 remaining
    folds form the training set.
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <k_fold>`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``n_splits`` default value changed from 3 to 5.
    shuffle : bool, default=False
        Whether to shuffle the data before splitting into batches.
        Note that the samples within each split will not be shuffled.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        When `shuffle` is True, `random_state` affects the ordering of the
        indices, which controls the randomness of each fold. Otherwise, this
        parameter has no effect.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> kf = KFold(n_splits=2)
    >>> kf.get_n_splits(X)
    2
    >>> print(kf)
    KFold(n_splits=2, random_state=None, shuffle=False)
    >>> for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf.split(X)):
    ...     print(f"Fold {i}:")
    ...     print(f"  Train: index={train_index}")
    ...     print(f"  Test:  index={test_index}")
    Fold 0:
      Train: index=[2 3]
      Test:  index=[0 1]
    Fold 1:
      Train: index=[0 1]
      Test:  index=[2 3]
    Notes
    -----
    The first ``n_samples % n_splits`` folds have size
    ``n_samples // n_splits + 1``, other folds have size
    ``n_samples // n_splits``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of samples.
    Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
    split. You can make the results identical by setting `random_state`
    to an integer.
